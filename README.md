# Getting Started

The setup file isn't yet setup up properly (work in progress). To run the program download
the repo and install the required packages then run the Clean.py file.

# Prerequisites
All the necessary packages are mentioned in requirements.txt. They can be installed by
running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For development purposes, I suggest you create a
virtual environment to keep a clear state, separate from your own setup.

Python3 Instructions:
`python -m venv organise_desktop`

To activate it, run `source organise_desktop/bin/activate`

### Build from Source

`$ git clone https://github.com/blavejr/OrganiseDesktop.git`
Navigate to the repo and run the following command:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
