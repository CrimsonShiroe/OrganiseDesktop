# OrganiseDesktop

Takes all the files on your desktop and put them in folders according to extensions. NO MORE MESSY DESKTOPS! atleast not on the outside :)

## Install

### Build from Source

`$ git clone https://github.com/blavejr/OrganiseDesktop.git`

**Navigate to the OrganiseDesktop folder**


**Now run Clean.py file.**

The setup file isn't ready yet but running the script directly should work, provided you have all the needed packages.

**Needed packages**
os
getpass
time
sys
tkinter

We will work on the setup file as soon as possible.

Enjoy and if you would like to help, send us a PR :)
